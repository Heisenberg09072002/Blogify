The home page of the website displays a list of the latest blog posts, sorted by date, with a brief introduction to each post. The reader can click on a post to read the full article, which is displayed on a separate page. Each post has a unique URL, which can be shared on social media or through other platforms.
The website has a navigation bar, which allows readers to access different sections of the website, such as the blog, about page, and contact page. The blog section has various categories, such as technology, lifestyle, and travel, to make it easier for readers to find articles that interest them.
The website also allows readers to search for articles using keywords or phrases, making it easier for them to find specific content. Additionally, the website has a commenting system, which allows readers to leave comments and engage in discussions with other readers and the author.
The website is designed to be responsive, meaning that it can adapt to different screen sizes, such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile phones. This ensures that readers can access the website and read articles regardless of the device they are using.
In conclusion, the blog website built using ReactJS and Express, with HTML and CSS for styling, provides a user-friendly experience for readers to browse and read through various articles and blog posts. The website's features, such as the navigation bar, search function, and commenting system, make it easy for readers to find and engage with content that interests them.

NEED
It is needed to show the texts or images in public places for better visual understanding and better communication. For example in today’s world it is used in traffic lights, malls and shopping complexes, public transportation like buses & metro and in widely many more areas. Keyboard based display schemes can also be used at other open places like hospital, railway stations, colleges, hotels and malls etc. The scrolling display board mainly consists of a receiver and shows a toolkit that can be programmed. It receives the message, through serial port and displays the required information after the code conversion.




OBJECTIVE
The objective of the project is to make a responsive fully functional application using React.js , Express.js and Node.js. Applying the concepts learnt in class we will be able to build a web page where the user can write , update and delete the blog as well as view other peoples blogs.The web site should be responsive and secure. The website should be secured and free from various attacks such as Cross Site Scripting , Cross Site Request Forgery and Sql injection. The website will feature an intuitive user interface that allows authors to create, edit, and publish their blog posts, while readers can easily navigate through the website to find interesting content. The website will also include features such as commenting, sharing, and liking to promote engagement and interaction among users. The ultimate goal of this blog website is to provide a platform for people to express themselves, learn from others, and foster meaningful connections.

METHODOLOGY
Here's a general methodology to create a blog website:
1.	Define the requirements and goals of the blog website: This includes deciding on the purpose of the website, target audience, and features to be included such as user registration, blog post creation, commenting system, and search functionality.
2.	Set up the development environment: Install Node.js and create a new project directory. Inside the directory, run npm init to create a new package.json file. Install the necessary dependencies such as React, Express, and any other packages needed.
3.	Build the backend with Express: Start by creating the server with Express. This involves setting up routes for handling HTTP requests and creating a database schema for storing blog posts, comments, and user information.
4.	Design the frontend with React: Create the necessary React components for the blog website such as the homepage, individual blog post pages, user registration and login pages, and the commenting system.
5.	Implement the frontend-backend communication: Use REST APIs to connect the frontend and backend of the website. The frontend will send HTTP requests to the backend, which will respond with JSON data.
6.	Implement user authentication and authorization: Set up user authentication and authorization using a package like Passport.js or JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to ensure that only authorized users can create, edit or delete blog posts and comments.
7.	Design the website layout and style with HTML and CSS: Create the HTML structure of the website using semantic HTML and style the website with CSS. Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material UI to create a responsive design that works on different devices.
8.	Deploy the website: Once the website is fully functional, deploy it to a hosting platform such as Heroku or Netlify.
9.	Maintain the website: Keep the website up-to-date by fixing bugs, updating dependencies, and adding new features as necessary. Use version control tools like Git to manage changes to the codebase.

Overall, creating a blog website with React.js, Express, HTML, and CSS requires a strong understanding of web development principles and a proficiency in the programming languages and tools involved.
